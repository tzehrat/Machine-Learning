# 📍 Linear Regression and Ridge Regression Models


In this project, two different regression models were used to make predictions on datasets.


## 📌 Datasets

### ✅ Advertising.csv:
This dataset examines the effect of investments in TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertisements on sales.
  
- Independent variables: TV, Radio, Newspaper
- Dependent variable: Sales

  
### ✅ Hitters.csv: 
This dataset predicts the salary of baseball players based on their independent variables.

- Independent variables: League, Division, New League
- Dependent variable: Salary

 
## 📌 Methods Used
  
### ✅ Linear Regression:

- In the "Advertising.csv" dataset, we modeled the relationship between TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads and sales.
- The model’s accuracy was evaluated using R² score and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Prediction results and the model equation were shown in a graph.
  
### ✅ Ridge Regression:

- In the "Hitters.csv" dataset, we used Ridge regression to predict players' salaries.
- L2 regularization was applied to prevent overfitting.
- Different alpha values (regularization coefficients) were tested to optimize the model.
- The best alpha value was chosen to obtain the final model results.
  
## 📌 Model Performance
For both models, the performance was measured using RMSE and R² score. In Ridge regression, L2 regularization was used to improve the model's accuracy.
